## Loadouts

Loadouts are the equipment you bring to the battlefield. They are composed of :
- A primary weapon system
- A secondary weapon system
- A vest
- A helmet
- A leg protection
- An arm protection
- Equipment


## **==IF YOU DIE DURING THE MISSION ALL YOUR LOADOUT WILL BE LOST==**

Each vest has a number of equipment slots. Filling all of them is optional.

## Armory

The armory is shared between all of the players. All of the collected, bought or awarded items go there. Before every mission the players will be given a briefing and they will be given time to discuss what to bring and who takes what.

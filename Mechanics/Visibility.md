Visibility represents the lighting conditions impairing the player or enemies ability to see and shoot properly 

It is mainly used for the [[Firing]] modifier calculation.

It can be changed by multiple factors :
- Environment (night, a switch turning off the lights)*
- Items (Night Vision Goggles, flashlight, flashbang)

This page assumes the attack has hit.

Each weapon has a damage roll specified :

We will continue the example from the [[Firing]] page using the M4 

The M4 has a 1d6 damage roll.

If the target does not have any armor he will simply take the damage rolled.

If the target has armor on the body part targeted :

Each armor piece has 2 statistics :

- Coverage (/20)
- Durability


The hit character will roll a d20, if the number is lower or equal to the coverage, the damage will be taken by the armor piece's durability rather than the character's health

The durability is kept between encounters unless the piece is repaired and the piece is destroyed when the durability falls to 0

Example : 

The enemy is wearing a civilian vest (Coverage : 10, Durability 50)

The player rolls a 4 on the 1d6 damage roll.

The enemy rolls a 6 on the coverage roll

The vest takes 4 damage to its durability : 50-4=46

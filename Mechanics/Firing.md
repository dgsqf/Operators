When firing a weapon, the player (or GM if an enemy is shooting) should roll a FIRING d20
(see rolling mechanic) the roll modifier is calculated as such

Visibility modifier (see [[Visibility]]) + Cover modifier (see [[Cover]])  + Distance Modifier

For example :

The player, has a FIRING stat of 13 and uses an M4
The visibility is dark (+1)
The enemy has no cover (+ 0)
The enemy is placed at medium range (M4 being a rifle the modifier is +0)
The modifier is 1+0+0 = +1

The players rolls a 13
Adding the modifier his final roll is 13
13 is lower than or equal to 13 so the players hits the enemy.


## Difficult shots

The player can also decide to shoot a specific part of the body.
The roll modifier is now calculated using a new term.

Visibility modifier (see visibility) + Cover modifier (see cover) + Distance Modifier + Difficulty Modifier

Target | Modifier 
-- | --
Head | +2
Legs | +1
Arms | +1


Using the same example as before, this time aiming for the head, the new modifier is


1+0+0+2= +1

The player rolls 13
Adding the modifier, the final roll is 16
16 is higher than 13 so the player doesn't hit the enemy
